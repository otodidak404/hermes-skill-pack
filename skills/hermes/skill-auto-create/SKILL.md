# Skill Auto-Create

Automatically generate new skill proposals from successful session patterns. The skill scans conversation history for repeated workflows, common errors, and user corrections, then generates a SKILL.md draft.

## When to use

- After a complex task succeeds (5+ tool calls, errors overcome)
- User says "simpen skill" / "save skill" / "buat skill dari ini"
- User-corrected approach worked and should be remembered
- After discovering a non-trivial workflow worth preserving
- Periodic review of recent sessions for skill-worthy patterns

## Auto-create procedure

### Step 1: Identify skill-worthy sessions

```bash
# Search recent sessions for complex tasks
session_search(query="error fix solved workaround", limit=10, sort="newest")

# Search for user corrections (usually become pitfalls)
session_search(query="tolol goblok napa ga", limit=5, sort="newest")

# Search for successful multi-step procedures
session_search(query="step 1 step 2 verify OK", limit=5, sort="newest")
```

### Step 2: Check if a skill already exists

```bash
# Before creating, check for existing coverage
skills_list

# If a similar skill exists, STRENGTHEN it instead of creating a new one
skill_view(name='<similar-skill>')
```

### Step 3: Extract skill content from session

From the session transcript, extract:

| Content type | Where in session | Skill section |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Task goal | First user message | Overview / When to use |
| Trigger phrase | User's words describing the task | When to use (trigger conditions) |
| Procedure steps | Tool calls in order | Procedure (Step 1, 2, ...) |
| Errors hit | Error messages in tool output | Pitfalls |
| User corrections | "tolol", "napa ga", "goblok" | Pitfalls (highest priority) |
| Verification | How success was confirmed | Verification steps |
| Commands that worked | Terminal commands that succeeded | Procedure / Scripts |

### Step 4: Generate SKILL.md draft

Structure the extracted content into the standard skill format:

```markdown
---
name: <descriptive-name>
description: "<one-line from task goal>"
tags: [keyword1, keyword2, ...]
# NO version field until published (Feb rule — unpublished skills carry no version number)

category: <mapped-category>

    tags: [keyword1, keyword2, ...]

# <Skill Title — must match frontmatter name>
```
## Overview
<from task goal — what this skill does>

## When to use
- <trigger condition 1>
- <trigger condition 2>
- User says "<exact phrase the user used>"

## Procedure
### Step 1: <action>
```bash
<command that worked>
```

### Step 2: <action>
<from successful tool call sequence>

## Pitfalls
1. **<pitfall name>** — <what went wrong> → <fix>
   - User correction: "<exact user words>" → <what the correction means>

## Verification
```bash
<command to verify success>
```

## Related skills
- `<existing-skill>` — <relationship>
```

### Step 5: Extract linked files

If the session produced:
- Long code blocks → `scripts/<name>.py`
- API endpoint tables → `references/api-endpoints.md`
- Configuration files → `templates/config.yaml`

```python
# Create linked files
skill_manage(action='write_file', name='<skill-name>',
  file_path='scripts/<helper>.py',
  file_content='<extracted code>')

skill_manage(action='write_file', name='<skill-name>',
  file_path='references/<topic>.md',
  file_content='<extracted reference>')
```

### Step 6: Create the skill

```python
skill_manage(action='create', name='<skill-name>',
  content='<full SKILL.md content>',
  category='<category>')
```

### Step 7: Verify

```bash
skill_view(name='<skill-name>')
```

## The "offer to save" pattern

After completing a difficult task, OFFER to save it as a skill:

```
"That took several iterations. Want me to save this as a skill so next time
it's a one-shot? It would cover: <brief summary of what the skill would include>."
```

Offer when ALL of these are true:
- ✅ 5+ tool calls
- ✅ Errors were overcome
- ✅ User corrected the approach at least once
- ✅ The workflow is reusable (not a one-off)

Do NOT offer when:
- ❌ Single tool call
- ❌ Simple mechanical task
- ❌ Task specific to this exact moment (e.g., "restart this one service now")

## Auto-creation from repeated patterns

When the same type of task appears across multiple sessions, auto-create a skill:

1. `session_search(query="<task keyword>", limit=5)` — find 3+ sessions with same task
2. Extract common steps across all sessions
3. Collect all unique pitfalls from each session
4. Merge into a single comprehensive skill
5. Create with `skill_manage(action='create')`

### Example: Farming skill auto-creation

Multiple sessions about farming different providers (pateway, tokenharbor, qoder) share:
- Same proxy rotation pattern
- Same tempmail provider fallback chain
- Same OTP polling strategy
- Same 9router inject shape

→ Auto-create `mass-account-api-key-farm` as the generic playbook, with provider-specific skills linking to it.

## Category auto-assignment

When generating a skill, auto-assign category based on keywords:

```python
CATEGORY_MAP = {
    "farm|farming|harvest|mass-account": "automation",
    "9router|gateway|proxy|sqlite|systemd": "devops",
    "audit|vuln|pentest|exploit|bounty": "bug-bounty",
    "pytorch|training|fine-tune|dataset": "mlops",
    "writing|blog|content|creative": "creative",
    "apple|macos|imessage": "apple",
    "skill|hermes|agent|memory": "hermes",
    "github|git|ci": "github",
}

def assign_category(desc, tags):
    text = (desc + " " + " ".join(tags)).lower()
    for keywords, category in CATEGORY_MAP.items():
        if any(kw in text for kw in keywords.split("|")):
            return category
    return None  # root-level if no match
```

## Pitfalls

1. **Always check `skills_list` before creating.** Creating a duplicate wastes effort and requires later audit+merge. 30 seconds of checking saves 10 minutes of merge work.
2. **Don't auto-create from single sessions.** One session might be a one-off. Look for repeated patterns across 2+ sessions before auto-creating. Exception: if the user explicitly says "simpen skill dari ini", create immediately.
3. **User corrections are the most valuable pitfalls.** When a user says "tolol" or "goblok" or "napa ga lu...", that's a pitfall waiting to be documented. Capture the exact user words — they encode the emotional weight of the lesson.
4. **Generated skills need human review.** Auto-generated content is a draft, not a final product. Review for: accuracy, completeness, correct commands, proper categorization.
5. **Always offer before auto-creating.** Don't silently create skills — the user might not want another skill cluttering their library. Use the "offer to save" pattern.
6. **Linked files make skills 10x more useful.** A skill with just SKILL.md is a concept. A skill with scripts/ and references/ is a toolkit. Always extract linked files when generating from a session.
7. **Version numbers: ONLY if published — otherwise ABSENT.** Per Feb's correction: NO `version:` in frontmatter, NO "v1.0" in the title, for any skill that isn't published yet. The template above and the frontmatter block default to OMITTING version. Only add a version once the skill is actually published/shipped. Don't "bump" versions of unpublished drafts.
8. **Title, frontmatter name, and filename must all sync.** If the skill is `web-engineering`, the H1 title is `# WEB ENGINEERING`, frontmatter `name: web-engineering`, and the delivered file is `web-engineering.md`. Don't use codename suffixes (`-v4`, `-rebuild`, `-fullstack`) in the filename/title for an unpublished skill — that's "amburadul" per Feb.
